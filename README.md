# Hangman
A Console Hangman game with ASCII art and options like having a saved high score, changing usernames, buying help for coins earned by winning, the ability to see the definition of a word.

## Difficulty
The words include basic english words as well as some of the hardest words to guess in a game like Hangman. A player can only miss a letter 6 times.

## Gameplay
If one doesn't know how to play this game, there is an option to choose in the game that will explain the rules.

### Disclaimer
Some of the characters used let's say in the 'Main Menu' may or may not display correctly. Everything is still readable and working, it's just not too pleasing visually.
